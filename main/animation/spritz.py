text_copy = """Baking the chicken wings at 375 degrees F for one hour instead of 400 degrees F for 45 minutes is a reasonable adjustment and can work well, depending on your preferences. Here are a few considerations for using this approach:

Gentler Cooking: Lowering the temperature and increasing the cooking time can result in a gentler cook, which might be beneficial if you want to ensure the wings are thoroughly cooked without the risk of burning or drying out the exterior too quickly. This can be especially useful if your oven tends to run hot.
Texture: The skin might not become as crisply as it would at a higher temperature, but it should still achieve a good texture, particularly with the second bake to crisp up the skin.
Even Cooking: A longer, slower bake can help the meat cook more evenly, which can be great for texture and juiciness.
Final Crispiness: Since the initial bake at a lower temperature might leave the skin less crispy, you'll want to ensure that the second bake (especially if youâ€™re adding a glaze or sauce) really focuses on achieving that crisp finish. You might consider increasing the temperature slightly during the second bake or even using the broil setting for the last few minutes to help crisp up the skin.
This adjustment can be a good way to adapt the recipe to your specific oven and preferences. Just keep an eye on the wings towards the end of the cooking time to ensure they are cooked through and have achieved your desired level of crispiness before proceeding with the second bake.
